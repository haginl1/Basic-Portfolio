<h1>Student Bio</h1>
<br>
<h2>Lisa Hagin</h2>
<br>
<p>Lisa has had a diverse career in software and telecom, having positions ranging from a software trainer, consultant, a sales engineer, and as a leader in product marketing and product management. She is a certified software trainer and is close to becoming a certified Project Management Professional.   Lisa worked at Brightree, where she was Director of Product Marketing for our SaaS-based healthcare solutions.  She has also held positions at Rockwell Collins, DataPath, and several other software companies.</p>

<p>Lisa has a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Tech, where she played varsity basketball and was an Aerospace Engineering CAD Software teaching assistant.<p>

<p>Lisa and her partner of 13 years, Mary, live in the Toco Hills area of Decatur, but they also enjoy spending as much time as possible in Savannah, on the water, fishing with Lisa’s father at their family home. When she’s not in Atlanta or Savannah, Lisa is in Vegas, cause that’s how she rolls…..if you spend any time with Lisa, you will learn that she LOVES Vegas, can mix a mean drink, brews her own beer, and LOVES fishing. She is also incredibly organized. Trust me, when things become chaotic, Lisa makes a plan, writes it down, and distributes it to everyone. When there really is a Zombie Apocalypse, I’m going to Lisa’s house, because she will actually know what to do next.<p>
<p>Other little known facts: Due to a soccer accident, Lisa is deaf in one ear (helpful to know when having a conversation), she can’t stand people munching chips while she’s trying to work ( she got her noise cancelling headphones cause we eat chips in Marketing), she has biked all over New Zealand and Holland (cool!), and she LOVES coffee ( she’s been brewing Turkish coffee most afternoons around 3ish if you ever want to join in the Rumpus Room)
